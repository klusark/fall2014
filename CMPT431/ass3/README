Everything should work as described in the assignment.

use -pirmary to specify the primary file location

When a server starts it will check the primary file, and if it can connect to
that server it becomes the backup. If it cannot connect it becomes the primary
and writes its information into the primary.txt file.

The backup server does not listen to connections, and thus also does not check
if the port it is given is available until it becomes master.

Because the server's ip address need to be written into the primary file,
you can't use 0.0.0.0 as the ip, and must instead use the address that the
server will be contacted on.

It prints messages about the current master/backup state in order to identify
who is currently the backup and who is the master.
